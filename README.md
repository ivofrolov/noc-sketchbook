# Sketchbook

I created this simple program to code along [The Nature of
Code](https://natureofcode.com/) but it can be used for any sketches.

It can

  * make menu list of files in [sketches](sketches) directory,
  * execute sketch compiled to dynamic library,
  * reload sketch on file change.

It's based on [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

### Building

`make sketchbook` to compile the app.

`make sketches/<name without extension>` to compile your sketch.
